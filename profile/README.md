## Project Overview
Watches.fyi aims to simplify the process of finding, tracking, and purchasing watches by aggregating listings from multiple watch marketplaces and providing tools to manage watch inventories, track prices, and set up notifications. This README describes how microservices, gRPC, and Kafka are used to achieve an efficient and scalable architecture for this platform.

## Key Features
- **Data Aggregator**: Collects listings from marketplaces like eBay, Chrono24, and others.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts users to new listings or price changes via Webhook, SMS, or email.
- **Marketplace**: Allows verified sellers to list watches for sale and supports buyer bids.
- **Inventory Management**: Helps users manage and track their watch collections.
- **User Forum**: A community space for discussing watches and sharing insights.

## Architecture

### Microservices
The Watches.fyi architecture is based on a microservices design to achieve modularity, scalability, and flexibility. The main services include:

- **Data Aggregator Service**: Collects data from external marketplaces and updates the Watches.fyi platform.
- **Notification Service**: Handles user notifications (webhook, SMS, email) for price changes or new listings.
- **Marketplace Service**: Manages buy/sell listings, bid processing, and marketplace interactions.
- **Inventory Service**: Allows users to track their collections, manage inventory, and sync listings across platforms.
- **Forum Service**: Hosts user discussions and posts related to watches.

Each microservice can be independently deployed and scaled based on the load and usage patterns, allowing Watches.fyi to grow without impacting other services.

### gRPC
gRPC is used for efficient communication between microservices, chosen for its high performance and low latency, which is essential for real-time data aggregation and notifications.

- **Data Aggregation**: gRPC enables fast, binary protocol communication, which allows the Data Aggregator Service to collect and transmit high volumes of data with minimal delay.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: gRPC allows microservices to communicate seamlessly, ensuring language interoperability and efficient data handling across the platform.

### Kafka
Kafka serves as the real-time event streaming platform for Watches.fyi, enabling robust data streaming and event processing.

- **Event-Driven Notifications**: Kafka is used to publish events for price changes, new listings, and user bids, which the Notification Service consumes to deliver real-time alerts to users.
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: External marketplace data flows into Kafka, where it is processed and distributed to the Data Aggregator Service.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Kafkaâ€™s fault tolerance and horizontal scalability make it well-suited for handling the data and traffic volume anticipated as Watches.fyi grows.
